## 🌟 About 

We create software solutions specifically for non-profits and NGOs. Our team comes from activism backgrounds, where we learned firsthand how important reliable tech infrastructure is during critical campaigns. Standard tools often miss the mark for mission-driven organizations, so we build flexible, customizable solutions that help you focus on impact instead of fighting with technology.
